LOG
12/2, T: Group meeting. Discussed splitting group into 2 pairs of partners: Mary & Xiaomeng, Austin & Khashi. 
12/3, W: Mary & Xiaomeng met to talk about 3 & 4.
	FieldSearch: add methods findLess, findGreater, findPrefix, findSuffix, findContains

	Add new class (ComboSearch) for combinations of searches
	Add new class (StringParser) for method parse
12/4: Th: Mary, Austin, Xiaomeng met to discuss roles in the project in more detail and continue work in the
	planning stage. Some notes are in Plan.txt.

	Add new class (IDSearch) for method findID
	Add new class (StringParser) for method parse
12/4 Th: Austin, Mary, Xiaomeng meet to discuss order of actions and outline a more specific plan of action. 
    	Began writing out the description of roles, unit test descriptions, etc for assignment due on Friday the 5th.
12/4 Th: Khashi researched REST interface 
12/5 F: Group met in discussion to decide initial plans
12/6 Sat: Austin and Khashi met for a few hours. Austin started reading through existing code to figure out the best
	course of action for implementing special searches. Khashi researched how to return an iterator. We were able to
	bounce ideas off of each other during this process.
12/6 S: Mary added 


12/8: Group meets to discuss structure for searches. Group decides Mary and Xiaomeng will focus on
	restructuring, while Austin and Khashi will focus on other things. Mary and Xiaomeng restructure searches 
	while Austin begins to research REST'
12/9: Austin spends an hour and a half before finally installing Maven. Austin feels accomplished.
12/9: Khashi researches Iterator and finishes StringIterator class, and creates StringIterator test. May make future changes.
12/9: After hours and hours of trying, Xiaomeng finally successfully figured out a design for combining all the Searches. 
	  Our design for searches:
	  1 Change Traverser (process) and Search (doSearch) to abstract class;
	  2 let all the different search classes extends from Search and override its doSearch method
	  3 Put different function classes (SearchField, SearchGreater,...)into Node.java file and let those functions
	    extends from Traverser and override its process() and getLst()
	  4 when doSearch calls D.fetch(Traverser t), it knows which function to perform.
	  
	  Xiaomeng also figured out the way to merge all the identifier lists of Node list returned by GreaterThanSearch, and passed the 
	  integration test for equal search and GreaterthanTest for Greaterthan search, which is implemented by Mary.
	  now that we have this design, every other searches can simply follow the way GreaterThanSearch is done.
	  The major part is finished. Xiaomeng also feels accomplished.

12/10: Austin: I researched more about adding a Server to the project, executed some examples to get a better idea, and ended up spending
	and hour or so trying to resolve some conflicts the group was having while syncing and committing. Also added Prefix, Suffix, and 
	Contains classes for searching.

12:11: Austin: Due to conflicting schedules with Khashi, Khashi and I decided to partition up the work in a different way. I added the
	tests for the different searches. Note to teammates that I added a getResult method inside the test class that will allow
	you to check that the result of your search is equal versus just checking to see if the length of the search is equal.
	
12/10: Mary realized she hasn't updated this in a while. 
		12/6: Added some test data for < and > searches, along with unit tests and initial code for GreaterThan and LessThan methods.
		12/7: Studied the base code, thinking of ways to implement < and > searches.
		12/8: Added unit test for ComboSearch.
		12/9: Had some issues with pushing to GitHub. Added < search. Made some changes in unit tests.
		12/10: Added orSearch, andSearch to ComboSearch. Added more tests for both. More tests to be added.
		To do: add more tests for <, > searches. Make sure to handle all cases.
		
12/11: Mary was trying to figure out why tests that should not return anything were not working. Found that an extra statement
	needed to be added to check if n was empty in LinearDiskDatabase and added it. Now, those kind of tests pass. Mary
	added more of those kinds of tests.
	
12/11: Mary, Austin, and Xiaomeng met for a while and worked on some integration tests together. We feel accomplished.
